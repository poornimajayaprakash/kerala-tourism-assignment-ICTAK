         <p>A landlocked district, Idukki is one of the most nature rich areas of Kerala. High ranges and wooded valleys are girded by three main rivers – Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar – and their tributaries.The River Pamba also has its origin here. As a tourist destination, Idukki offers diverse attractions like Wildlife sancturies, Hill stations, Dams, Spece plantation tours, Mountain treks, Elephant rides etc.
            Idukki is an alluring retreat for tourists in God’s Own Country. Clad in dense green forest and crowned with verdant mountains, it boasts of Anamudi, the highest peak in India. Besides, it also takes pride in being the abode of the second largest arch dam in the world.<br><br> Being a part of Chera Dynasty and the home of many early European settlers, Idukki has grabbed a place in the history. It has been an important business hub for many ages as teak, rosewood, sandalwood, ivory and peacock etc are said to be exported from here to many far-off countries. Idukki bears testimony of a stone-age civilization, though many historians believe Paleolithic men inhabited here. Remnants of Menhir and Tombs belonging to stone-age were excavated in 1947-48 near Udumbanchola and Peermede.
