         <p>Calicut, also known by the name Kozhikode, is a northern district located on India’s south-west coastal belt. The headquarters of this district is also known by the same name i.e. the city of Calicut. Surrounded by the Arabian Sea in the west, this region was the glorious centre of trade and commerce in the bygone era. According to modern day historians, Calicut was best known for its spices and silk - a reason why it had successfully established trade links with many countries in the Indian Ocean. Strong commercial links with many African, Asian and Middle East countries made Calicut a buzzing economic hub in its golden days. Calicut came under the British East India Company during the colonial times and was administered under Madras Presidency. Calicut has its share in the world history for it was in Kappad (18 km away from Calicut) Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese navigator, landed in the year 1498. This historical moment was honoured by constructing a monument at that place which is a popular tourist attraction in Calicut.Of all the things Calicut is famed for, its culture and cuisines stand out demanding the attention of travellers and historians alike. This region is the birthplace of the world famous folk songs known by the name Vadakkan Pattukal.
