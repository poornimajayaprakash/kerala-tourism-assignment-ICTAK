         <p>Kannur is a town in the northern coastal region of Kerala. It was also known as Cannanore during the British Raj. The name Kannur has two etymological possibilities. One is that the name was derived from an ancient village called Kanathur. The other theory is that it is a mix of two words, Kannan- meaning Lord Krishna and Ur- meaning place, making the literal translation to be ‘The place of Lord Krishna’. It has been titled as the Land of Looms and Lores due to the loom industry here.

            The town is famous for its temple festivals where the popular dance form of Theyyam is performed. This town is rich in natural beauty. There are some ancient forts, unperturbed wildlife, pristine beaches and famed temples, which have contributed to the blooming tourism of the place. Thousands of pilgrims flock this town in the months of June and July to be a part of Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam, a religious pilgrimage festival.</p><br><br>

                  <p class="card-text a4">St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen. There are tombstones of the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the fort, barracks and an old chapel here that you can explore. Kannur's first ever lighthouse also stands next to the fort and adds to its already hypnotic glory.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

                  <p class="card-text a4">The impeccably unspoiled Payyabalam beach is adorned with sparkling pearls of golden sand and foamy white waves of the Arabian Sea. The highlight of Kannur and one of the many beautiful beaches of Kerala, the Payyabalam beach has an incredibly peaceful and inviting aura. Unwind after a long week by relaxing at this remarkable seashore and find yourself mesmerized by its elegant beauty and contagious calm. The approach to the beach is through a small crossover bridge that is built over a narrow canal. To the right of the bridge are the memorials of Kannur's important political personalities that had passed away over the recent decades. </p><br><br><br>

Previously a majestic palace of the royal family and their actual place of residence, this museum is a true testimony to the impeccable Muslim architecture and design. The Durbar Hall of this palace, which was once the official venue of gathering for the kings and their nobles, has now been converted into the Arakkal Kettu Museum and is managed by the Arakkal Family Trust.<br><br><br></p><br><br><br>
