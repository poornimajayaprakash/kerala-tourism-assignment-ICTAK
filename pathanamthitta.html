                  <p class="card-text a4">Sabarimala is a revered Hindu shrine located in the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. It is one of the famous places of pilgrimage in Kerala as well as in India.

                    Dedicated Lord Ayyappan, Sabarimala temple is one of the oldest temples in India, with a history of more than 5000 years old. It is one of the most visited pilgrim centers in the world with an estimated 45 - 50 million devotees every year, and among the top places to visit in Kerala. The temple is situated amid 18 hills, at an altitude of about 3000 feet. It is believed that Lord Parasurama installed the idol of Ayyappa at Sabarimala.
                    
                    The pilgrimage season begins in November and ends in January (the temple remains closed during the rest of the year except for the first five days of each Malayalam month). The devotees following Ayyappa Vratam (Ayyappa Maala - a 41 days Vratam with strict restrictions) carry Irumudi Kettu containing traditional offerings to the Lord. Mandalapooja (Nov17th) and Makaravilakku (Jan 14th) are the important events of the temple. Makara Jyothi (a celestial star) appeared on Jan 14th is the most crowded occasion of this temple.

                  <p class="card-text a4">At a distance of 10 Kms from Pathanamthitta, Konni is famous as an Elephant Training Center. It is located near Iravan village (less than 1 Km) on SH67 between Pathanamthitta and Pathanapuram.

                    Located in thick forest environment, this training center was used to train wild elephants. However, this place is not used for elephant trainings any more. The big wooden cages used to put newly brought wild elephant for training are still an attraction. Elephant safaris are available at this place along with adventurous trekking programs. Konni has the largest wild elephant population in Kerala.

                  <p class="card-text a4">At a distance of 15 Km from Pathanamthitta, 53 Km from Alappuzha & 57 Km from Kumarakom, Aranmula is a Aranmula Snake Boat Race, also known as Aranmula Vallamkali is a popular boat race held in the never ending Kerala Backwaters.

                    Aranmula Vallamkali owes its origin to the Sri Parthasarathy Temple situated on the banks of the Pamba River. The Vallamkali, associated with the annual festival of Sri Parthasarathy, is usually held on the last two days of the festival. The event that attracts tourists from all over the world is conducted not to win any trophy or prize but to celebrate the anniversary of the Sri Krishna idol installation, the main deity at the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. It is conducted in the Pamba River in front of the temple to commemorate the crossing of the river by Lord Krishna.
                    
                    The snake boats assemble near the Parthasarathy Temple before the race begins. Festivities take over the whole town as well as the waters. The boat race is famous worldwide and has become an icon of Kerala, attracting thousands of tourists every year during the festival of Onam.</p>
