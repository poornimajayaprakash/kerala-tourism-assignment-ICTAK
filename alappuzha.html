                  <p class="card-text a4">One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.

                    The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.</p>

                  <p class="card-text a4">Famous as the Alappuzha lighthouse,  the Alleppey lighthouse can be spotted from miles away. A humongous tower celebrating the solitude by the coastal strip wearing strips of red and white is how it is best reminisced.

                    The phenomenal tower was first installed in March 1862, almost 148 years ago. Located at around 4 kilometers ahead of the Alappuzha town, Alleppey or Alappuzha lighthouse grants a panoramic 360-degree view of the ocean as well as the territorial land of Alleppey which is majorly thick and lush foliage.
                    
                    Flaunting its badge of being one of the oldest lighthouses of Kerala, its construction dates back to the time when Marthanda Varma- II Maharaja owned the throne of the region.</p>

                    <p class="card-text a4">This is one of the most beautiful Alappuzha tourist places that you absolutely cannot miss. Vembanad Lake is Kerala’s longest lake and is also among the largest in India. Several canals empty their water into the lake at several points along its wide expanse. Since it is a long lake, it covers many districts of Kerala and goes by different names in each district like Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. Many small islands dot its length. 

                        Boating in this lake is a part of backwater trip in Kerala. The Kumarakom Tourist Village offers houseboat cruises and holiday packages which you can take advantage of and so have the best possible backwater boating experience on your trip. The lake is full of exciting possibilities- just imagine yourself floating on the lake early in the morning, sipping a hot cup of coffee and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves and chirping of birds. Now that is peace and happiness!
